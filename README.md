## Examples

Here is an example of a program written in Zero Script that prints the numbers 1 to 10:
```bash
For (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
{
  Log(i);
}
```
Here is an example of a program written in Zero Language that calculates the factorial of a number:
```bash
Function Factorial(int n)
{
  int result = 1;
  For (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  {
    result = result * i;
  }
  Log(result);
}
EndFunction

Factorial(5);
```
